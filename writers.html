          <p>Hello! I love designing games and stabbing people, er, I mean fencing. Who doesn't right? I really want to get a PhD in games and computer science to better tell stories with said games. I am known among my close friends for my uncanny ability to consume unhealthy amounts of green apples. You know what they say, one apple an hour keeps the doctor away. I put this idiom to the test every day.</p>

          <p>Inhabiting the world of Naruto and owning the Death Note are just some of my secrets. During my free time, when I’m not watching vines on facebook, I can be observed in my natural habitat doing whatever I can find to kill boredom, whether it’s heading to the gym or catching up on seasons. </p>

          <p>I love cooking and baking. (I make awesome choreo cookies!) Been recently into Korean hiphop music, but my all time favorite is The Strokes. My dream is to travel to Iceland but I’m afraid that once I get there, I will fall in love with the place and I will never be able to leave. Sometimes you can spot me singing in the rain (literally) because I really like the smell of the rain. The first thing I want to do when I graduate is to get a cat.</p>

          <p>If a person could be described as a fruit, I’d be a potato. I love playing on my ukulele and every once in awhile  jam on a drum set to Radiohead, Nirvana or Pearl Jam. I love space, stars, planets, galaxies, black holes, quasars, nebulae, turtles, puppies, and flannel shirts. (I have 10 in my Abu Dhabi Wardrobe). The other things I just dream about while playing on the aforementioned ukulele / drum set.</p>

          <p>Colors, lights and music make me happy but happy movies often make me sad. I am dangerously clumsy and my clumsiness never fails to surprise and entertain even the people who have known me for years. I never get lost in physical space but most of the times I feel lost in life among my dreams. At least I must be a great actress – my friends tell me I look like I have it all figured out.</p>

          <p>I spend most of my time writing, whether it be in Java, Python, English, Russian or Romanian. My passions include spoken word poetry, comedy hip hop, having entire conversations using only GIFs, collecting cow-themed objects and annoying friends with my puns. The title of my autobiography will be “Once a Paula time.” </p>
